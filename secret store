🧩 Product Overview: A Digital Vault for Everyone
You're creating a secure file storage platform — call it a Digital Vault — built to serve two types of users:

Regular people who want privacy without needing a tech degree

High-risk users who need legal-grade protection, secrecy, or insurance

The value lies in giving both groups real encryption, self-sovereignty, and fail-safes, without compromising UX.

👥 Audience Breakdown
1. Regular Users ("Everyday Privacy")
Target: Teens, families, freelancers, partners, creatives, etc.

What They Want:
To store private files (IDs, journals, photos, contracts)

Easy-to-use app, works on phone/laptop

Sharing without risking public exposure

Knowing their files aren’t being mined or viewed

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🧨 Most Competitors Are Missing the Individual User Completely
The majority of “secure storage” players today are:

Enterprise-focused (Tresorit, CitizenVault, ZeroVaults)

Overengineered for business compliance (HIPAA/GDPR checkboxes)

Not designed for real people — like your mate, your little sister, or someone just trying to safely stash a private doc or backup

Even the consumer-facing ones (like Filen, Internxt, pCloud) don’t go far enough:

Feature	Filen	Internxt	pCloud	Your Platform
Zero-knowledge	✅	✅	⚠️ optional	✅ by default
Easy UX	✅	⚠️ meh	✅	✅
Designed for families/teens	❌	❌	❌	✅
Legal-grade audit logs	❌	❌	❌	✅
Dead-man switch / inheritance	❌	❌	❌	✅
Anonymous / burner-friendly	❌	❌	❌	✅ (optional)
Recovery options for non-techies	⚠️	❌	✅	✅
Court-use bundle export	❌	❌	❌	✅

💥 Bottom Line: You’re Not Competing with Them — You’re Filling Their Blind Spot
No one’s doing:
True privacy for normal people

Paranoia-grade tools available without enterprise pricing

Peace-of-mind features like "what if I die?", "what if I get arrested?", "what if I just want to disappear for a bit?"

You're democratising digital privacy — not just selling encrypted storage.

📌 Real Use Cases You’re Serving — That They’re Not:
A teenager wants to store journal entries and school docs without Google indexing their life.

A victim of domestic abuse wants to store photos, audio, and chat logs securely for future legal use.

A freelancer wants to stash contracts and invoices in a tamper-proof vault.

A whistleblower wants to prepare a document and set a release timer if they’re silenced.

A parent wants to store a will and instructions to unlock it only after they’re gone.

None of the major players are seriously building for these people. You're the first to say:

“Yeah, you don’t have to be a corporation to deserve ironclad privacy.”

If you nail this, mz, you’re building the Proton of private file storage — except this time, it's human-first, not enterprise-chasing.

File recovery in case of lost password/device

UX Considerations:
Clean UI, simple terminology

“Google Drive, but no spying”

Backup/recovery options (recovery phrase, MFA)

Soft onboarding, maybe passwordless (magic links/passkeys)

2. Unusual / Power Users ("High-Stakes Privacy")
Target: Journalists, whistleblowers, lawyers, victims, activists

What They Want:
Control over who, when, and how their data is accessed

A zero-trust architecture — you (the platform) should never see their files

A dead-man switch, in case they disappear or die

Immutable logs for legal proof / court cases

Options to delete remotely or auto-wipe

Possibly geo-fenced access (files can only be opened in X region)

UX Considerations:
“Advanced Mode” toggle to unlock powerful tools

No forced identity — use aliases, crypto wallets, or burner emails

No backup or password recovery unless explicitly configured

💸 Plans & Pricing Strategy
Tiered approach to monetise wisely:

Plan	Audience	Price	Key Features
🟢 SafeKeep (Free)	Regular users	Free	Encrypted uploads, 2FA, recovery options, mobile-friendly
🟡 DeepVault	Serious privacy users	£5/month	End-to-end encryption, hidden filenames, no analytics
🔴 Obsidian Mode	High-risk users	£10–20/month	Dead-man switch, audit trails, no recovery, auto-purge
⚫ Legacy Vault	Legal/posthumous use	Custom	Delayed unlocks, co-signing (e.g., with lawyer), export to notarised PDF

This lets regular people start for free, and converts serious users into paid subscribers. You’re monetising risk, not just storage.

🔐 Core Platform Features (Must-Haves)
Feature	Description
Client-side encryption	Files are encrypted in-browser before upload. You never see the plain text.
Zero-knowledge architecture	No file contents, no metadata, no IP logs unless explicitly enabled.
Immutable audit logs	File hash, upload/download timestamps, IP/device (optional). Use AWS QLDB or append-only log.
2FA / biometric unlock	Add an extra layer for sensitive users (e.g., TouchID or YubiKey).
Secure file sharing	End-to-end encrypted links with expiry or access restrictions.
Passwordless login	Passkeys, recovery phrases, or one-time magic links to reduce friction.

🧠 Advanced/Power Features (Optional for Most, Critical for Some)
Feature	Why it Matters
Dead-man switch	If user goes inactive, files are released or deleted — useful for whistleblowers, abuse victims, etc.
Self-destructing files	Burn after reading, one-time access, timed expiry — adds protection.
"Release on death" triggers	Store a final message or documents that unlock only after a condition (e.g. no logins for 90 days, confirmation from a trusted contact).
Geofenced access	Files only decryptable in certain countries or networks (basic IP fencing or device certs).
File notarisation/export	Package files + logs + timestamps into a court-usable export bundle.
Open API / CLI	Power users can build automations or integrate into custom workflows (e.g., a whistleblower tool).

🛠 Tech Stack (Recommended AWS-first)
Area	Tech
Storage	AWS S3 (Object Lock, versioning)
Encryption	WebCrypto API / libsodium (client-side)
Identity/Auth	AWS Cognito (with FIDO2/passkeys)
Audit Logs	AWS QLDB, DynamoDB, or custom immutable logs
Triggers	AWS Lambda for dead-man switch, expiry logic
App Hosting	React/Next.js frontend, Node.js backend (or Go if you want security & performance)
Monitoring	CloudWatch (internal only, no user data tracking)
