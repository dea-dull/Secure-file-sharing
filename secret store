🧩 Product Overview: A Digital Vault for Everyone
You're creating a secure file storage platform — call it a Digital Vault — built to serve two types of users:

Regular people who want privacy without needing a tech degree

High-risk users who need legal-grade protection, secrecy, or insurance

The value lies in giving both groups real encryption, self-sovereignty, and fail-safes, without compromising UX.

👥 Audience Breakdown
1. Regular Users ("Everyday Privacy")
Target: Teens, families, freelancers, partners, creatives, etc.

What They Want:
To store private files (IDs, journals, photos, contracts)

Easy-to-use app, works on phone/laptop

Sharing without risking public exposure

Knowing their files aren’t being mined or viewed

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


🧨 Most Competitors Are Missing the Individual User Completely
The majority of “secure storage” players today are:

Enterprise-focused (Tresorit, CitizenVault, ZeroVaults)

Overengineered for business compliance (HIPAA/GDPR checkboxes)

Not designed for real people — like your mate, your little sister, or someone just trying to safely stash a private doc or backup

Even the consumer-facing ones (like Filen, Internxt, pCloud) don’t go far enough:

Feature	Filen	Internxt	pCloud	Your Platform
Zero-knowledge	✅	✅	⚠️ optional	✅ by default
Easy UX	✅	⚠️ meh	✅	✅
Designed for families/teens	❌	❌	❌	✅
Legal-grade audit logs	❌	❌	❌	✅
Dead-man switch / inheritance	❌	❌	❌	✅
Anonymous / burner-friendly	❌	❌	❌	✅ (optional)
Recovery options for non-techies	⚠️	❌	✅	✅
Court-use bundle export	❌	❌	❌	✅

💥 Bottom Line: You’re Not Competing with Them — You’re Filling Their Blind Spot
No one’s doing:
True privacy for normal people

Paranoia-grade tools available without enterprise pricing

Peace-of-mind features like "what if I die?", "what if I get arrested?", "what if I just want to disappear for a bit?"

You're democratising digital privacy — not just selling encrypted storage.

📌 Real Use Cases You’re Serving — That They’re Not:
A teenager wants to store journal entries and school docs without Google indexing their life.

A victim of domestic abuse wants to store photos, audio, and chat logs securely for future legal use.

A freelancer wants to stash contracts and invoices in a tamper-proof vault.

A whistleblower wants to prepare a document and set a release timer if they’re silenced.

A parent wants to store a will and instructions to unlock it only after they’re gone.

None of the major players are seriously building for these people. You're the first to say:

“Yeah, you don’t have to be a corporation to deserve ironclad privacy.”

If you nail this, mz, you’re building the Proton of private file storage — except this time, it's human-first, not enterprise-chasing.

File recovery in case of lost password/device

UX Considerations:
Clean UI, simple terminology

“Google Drive, but no spying”

Backup/recovery options (recovery phrase, MFA)

Soft onboarding, maybe passwordless (magic links/passkeys)

2. Unusual / Power Users ("High-Stakes Privacy")
Target: Journalists, whistleblowers, lawyers, victims, activists

What They Want:
Control over who, when, and how their data is accessed

A zero-trust architecture — you (the platform) should never see their files

A dead-man switch, in case they disappear or die

Immutable logs for legal proof / court cases

Options to delete remotely or auto-wipe

Possibly geo-fenced access (files can only be opened in X region)

UX Considerations:
“Advanced Mode” toggle to unlock powerful tools

No forced identity — use aliases, crypto wallets, or burner emails

No backup or password recovery unless explicitly configured

💸 Plans & Pricing Strategy
Tiered approach to monetise wisely:

Plan	Audience	Price	Key Features
🟢 SafeKeep (Free)	Regular users	Free	Encrypted uploads, 2FA, recovery options, mobile-friendly
🟡 DeepVault	Serious privacy users	£5/month	End-to-end encryption, hidden filenames, no analytics
🔴 Obsidian Mode	High-risk users	£10–20/month	Dead-man switch, audit trails, no recovery, auto-purge
⚫ Legacy Vault	Legal/posthumous use	Custom	Delayed unlocks, co-signing (e.g., with lawyer), export to notarised PDF

This lets regular people start for free, and converts serious users into paid subscribers. You’re monetising risk, not just storage.

🔐 Core Platform Features (Must-Haves)
Feature	Description
Client-side encryption	Files are encrypted in-browser before upload. You never see the plain text.
Zero-knowledge architecture	No file contents, no metadata, no IP logs unless explicitly enabled.
Immutable audit logs	File hash, upload/download timestamps, IP/device (optional). Use AWS QLDB or append-only log.
2FA / biometric unlock	Add an extra layer for sensitive users (e.g., TouchID or YubiKey).
Secure file sharing	End-to-end encrypted links with expiry or access restrictions.
Passwordless login	Passkeys, recovery phrases, or one-time magic links to reduce friction.

🧠 Advanced/Power Features (Optional for Most, Critical for Some)
Feature	Why it Matters
Dead-man switch	If user goes inactive, files are released or deleted — useful for whistleblowers, abuse victims, etc.
Self-destructing files	Burn after reading, one-time access, timed expiry — adds protection.
"Release on death" triggers	Store a final message or documents that unlock only after a condition (e.g. no logins for 90 days, confirmation from a trusted contact).
Geofenced access	Files only decryptable in certain countries or networks (basic IP fencing or device certs).
File notarisation/export	Package files + logs + timestamps into a court-usable export bundle.
Open API / CLI	Power users can build automations or integrate into custom workflows (e.g., a whistleblower tool).

🛠 Tech Stack (Recommended AWS-first)
Area	Tech
Storage	AWS S3 (Object Lock, versioning)
Encryption	WebCrypto API / libsodium (client-side)
Identity/Auth	AWS Cognito (with FIDO2/passkeys)
Audit Logs	AWS QLDB, DynamoDB, or custom immutable logs
Triggers	AWS Lambda for dead-man switch, expiry logic
App Hosting	React/Next.js frontend, Node.js backend (or Go if you want security & performance)
Monitoring	CloudWatch (internal only, no user data tracking)

🔮 Taglines & Positioning (Feel Free to Use)
“Built for Everyone. Trusted by No One.”

“Secure your secrets — even from us.”

“Private storage for your stories, your safety, your silence.”

“If your life depended on one file — where would you put it?”

✅ What to Do Next (Your Move)
Define MVP Scope

SafeKeep basic: upload, encrypt, store, share

Basic auth, recovery, clean UI

Design Advanced Mode

Optional toggle in settings → unlock dead-man, logs, file expiry

Start Landing Page Copy

Split messaging: “Simple for families. Secure enough for whistleblowers.”

Build Initial AWS Arch

Get encryption, storage, and user auth working first

Decide Your Recovery Policy

Will you allow password recovery? Or make that a paid feature? This changes your liability and trust model.

🔐 SafeKeep – Foundational Product Strategy & Vision
A privacy-first, legal-grade file vault SaaS for everyday users and high-risk individuals

Author: mz
Prepared by: ChatGPT
Date: August 2025

🧭 Mission Statement
To provide individuals — both everyday users and at-risk people — with a secure, zero-knowledge vault for storing sensitive files, evidence, and personal data, backed by legal-grade privacy and trust-first infrastructure.

🔑 Core Features (MVP & Beyond)
Feature	Purpose
Client-side encryption (zero-knowledge)	User data is encrypted before ever touching your server
Secure storage (AWS-backed)	Use S3, Glacier or similar for scalability + reliability
Audit logs & verifiable timestamps	Legally defensible history of file uploads/changes
Dead-man switch / release on death	Files are automatically released if user doesn’t check in
Self-destructing files / burn links	Time-based or single-access deletion logic
Posthumous release / inheritance logic	“In case of death” vault sharing with verification
Simple, paranoid UX	Trust-first interface: clean, cautious, and calm, not cluttered
Multi-plan system	Split between regular users and high-trust users (journalists, survivors, lawyers)

🎯 Target Audience
Tier	Users
🟢 Everyday Users	Teens, families, students, hobbyists
🟡 Power Users	Journalists, lawyers, creators, activists, survivors
🔴 High-Security Clients	Whistleblowers, researchers, legal/compliance teams (future phase)

💸 Pricing Strategy (Initial Recommendations)
Plan	Price	Features
SafeKeep Free	£0	1–3 GB storage, encrypted uploads, burn links
SafeKeep Pro	£4.99/mo	50 GB, secure sharing, vault search, recovery
DeepVault	£9.99/mo	250 GB, audit logs, tamper-evident chains
Obsidian Mode	£14.99/mo	1 TB, inheritance, dead-man switch, stealth mode
Legacy Plan (Custom)	£30+/mo	Legal support, co-signed unlocks, lawyer-friendly export

🧠 Pricing reflects privacy-as-a-service, not just “storage”
Competing with Filen or Dropbox on GB/£ is a race to the bottom — you're selling control and peace of mind

🧱 Open Source & Transparency Strategy
Component	Policy
Client-side encryption logic	✅ Open-source (e.g. MIT/AGPLv3) — builds trust
Audit log structure	✅ Open or published spec — legally verifiable
Frontend logic (if using base like Filen)	✅ Open-source fork, licensed AGPLv3
Core backend infrastructure	❌ Closed — protects business logic and monetisation
Secrets, CI/CD, pricing logic	❌ Private and secured
Whitepaper / Trust Manifesto	✅ Publish encryption model, threat model, and fail-safe guarantees

🔍 On Using Filen’s Open Source Code
Filen’s code (frontend, mobile) is AGPLv3

You can reuse and modify it

You must open-source your changes to the frontend if you're hosting it as a service

You can keep backend closed and build commercial features on top

Recommendation: Use their frontend components as a jumpstart, with heavy customisation and branding

🤺 Competitive Landscape
Competitor	Focus	Weakness
Filen.io	Cheap encrypted storage	No chain-of-custody, no posthumous logic, no legal-grade features
Tresorit / Sync.com / Proton Drive	Enterprise/compliance	Too complex or expensive for individuals
Internxt / pCloud	Privacy branding	Shallow in legal safety, minimal unique features
You (SafeKeep)	Legally defensible trust system	New market, under-served needs, no good alternatives

💡 Your Unique Edge
Privacy logic > Storage quantity

Legally oriented features (audit chains, tamper-evidence, legacy access)

Design for paranoia – trust-first UX, clear threat models

Affordable for everyday users

Publicly verifiable encryption model

🚧 Next Steps
✅ Finalise MVP features & pricing tiers

🔓 Fork Filen’s frontend (if desired), apply AGPLv3 and build on top

🔐 Define and isolate backend architecture (AWS, KMS, S3 Glacier, etc.)

📄 Write encryption model spec & whitepaper

🧪 Build trust layer: “What happens if I die?” workflows, vault triggers

🚀 Launch a private beta for 10–50 users

🧠 Closing Thought
You’re not just building "secure file storage" — you’re building a digital vault for people who need peace of mind when it matters most.

If done right, people will pay to feel protected, not just to store data.
